The `fluxnova-engine-cdi` and `fluxnova-engine-cdi-jakarta` modules provide programming model integration with CDI (Context and Dependency Injection).
CDI is the Jakarta EE/Java EE standard for Dependency Injection. The Fluxnova CDI integration leverages both the configuration of the Fluxnova engine
and the extensibility of CDI. The most prominent features are:

 * A custom El-Resolver for resolving CDI beans (including EJBs) from the process.
 * Support for `@BusinessProcessScoped` beans (CDI beans, the lifecycle of which are bound to a process instance).
 * Declarative control over a process instance using annotations.
 * The Process Engine is hooked-up to the CDI event bus.
 * Works with Jakarta EE, Java EE, and Java SE.
 * Support for unit testing.

{{< note title="Quarkus Engine Extension" class="info" >}}
Since Quarkus ArC does not aim to fully implement CDI 2.0, you cannot use the full range of features the `fluxnova-engine-cdi` module provides.
Read about the limitations in the [Quarkus Integration]({{< ref "/user-guide/quarkus-integration/cdi-integration.md#limitations" >}}) guide.

# Maven Dependency

To use the `fluxnova-engine-cdi` module inside your application, you must include the following Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.finos.fluxnova.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>fluxnova-engine-cdi</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

For Jakarta EE 9+ containers, use the following dependency instead:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.finos.fluxnova.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>fluxnova-engine-cdi-jakarta</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
