First, you need to install the Fluxnova Platform and the Fluxnova Modeler.

In the following section, we'll describe how to install the Fluxnova Platform locally on your machine.

{{< note title="Hint" class="info" >}}
If you prefer, you can also run the Fluxnova Platform with Docker:

```sh
docker pull fluxnova/fluxnova-bpm-platform:run-latest
docker run -d --name fluxnova -p 8080:8080 fluxnova/fluxnova-bpm-platform:run-latest
```

Afterwards, you can [install the Fluxnova Modeler](#fluxnova-modeler).

# Fluxnova Platform

First, download a distribution of the Fluxnova Platform. You can choose from different distributions for [various application servers]({{< ref "/installation/full/" >}}). In this tutorial, we'll use Fluxnova Platform Run. Download it from [the download page](https://fluxnova.finos.org/download/platform).

After downloading the distribution, unpack it inside a directory of your choice.

After you've successfully unpacked your distribution of the Fluxnova Platform, execute the script named `start.bat` (for Windows users) or `start.sh` (for Unix users).

This script will start the application server. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to visit the Welcome Page. 

# Fluxnova Modeler

Download the Fluxnova Modeler from [the download page](https://fluxnova.finos.org/download/modeler/).

After downloading the Modeler, simply unzip the download in a folder of your choice.

After you have successfully unpacked the zip, run `fluxnova-modeler.exe` (for Windows users), `fluxnova-modeler.app` (for Mac users), or `fluxnova-modeler.sh` (for Linux users).

{{< note title="Next Step" class="info" >}}
Once you've installed the Fluxnova Platform and the Fluxnova Modeler, you can move to the next step to [model and execute your first process]({{< ref "/get-started/quick-start/service-task/" >}}).
